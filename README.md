# Course: Web2890 project-1
For this first 2890 project I was asked to create a website for Cardeal. This is a fictitious company that will give you cash for your car.  I had to create the one-page Cardeal website using Bootstrap 5 and SASS. This project gave me an opportunity to apply what I learned in the last Review Bootstrap and SASS Assignment.
